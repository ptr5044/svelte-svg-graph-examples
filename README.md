# Vanilla SVG Svelte Graphs

Created by Phillip Rubin

## Why Me?

Svelte offers some incredible capabilities for data visualization but creating SVG graphs from scratch can be a huge headache. The opposite approach is to import an out-of-the-box charting library that can often limit creative freedoms and add bloat to your bundle. Here is a set of reusable SVG graphs I created to save time and modify for any given project. It is still under development -- don't take it too seriously

# Getting Starting

Either copy/paste a section of the code for reuse or run locally using the following:

1. git clone...
2. yarn / npm install
3. yarn dev / npm run dev
